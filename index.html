                        <p>Senior counsel Vijay Narayanan, representing EPS, made a mention before Justice N Satishkumar
                            when the latter commenced his work for the day in the morning. He requested the judge to
                            hear the case relating to the removal of the seal affixed at the doors of the party
                            headquarters at Avvai Shanmugam Salai in the city's Royapettah locality. "You file the
                            petition. I will hear you tomorrow," the judge replied. The counsel for OPS, as
                            Panneerselvam is also known, later made a similar request to the judge. "You complete the
                            petition filing formalities. I will take up the matter tomorrow," the judge told the
                            counsel.</p>
                        <p>Following a violent clash between the supporters of EPS and OPS at the party headquarters on
                            July 11, ahead of the party's General Council that elected Palaniswami to the present
                            position and booted out OPS and his supporters from the AIADMK, the Revenue department had
                            affixed the seal on the doors of the office. The seal was affixed fearing the creation of
                            law and order problems and to maintain peace and tranquility in the area, the authorities
                            had explained while affixing the seal.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>The resolution accused Panneerselvam of siding with the DMK regime and having ties with the
                            ruling party leaders and working to weaken the AIADMK. OPS acted against the party
                            interests, its goals and principles. He took steps including approaching police to stall the
                            June 23 General Council meet, which was jointly convened by him along with Palaniswami.</p>
                        <p>Responding, Panneerselvam said he was elected as Coordinator by “1.5 crore" party workers and
                            that neither Palaniswami nor another leader, K P Munusamy, had the right to expel him. He
                            added that neither EPS not any other leader had the right to expel him.</p>

                        <p>The Madras High Court on Monday rejected a plea from AIADMK leader and former co-ordinator O
                            Panneerselvam to stay the conduct of the general council meeting holding that the court
                            cannot interfere into the squabbles of a political party. Justice Krishnan Ramaswamy
                            delivered the verdict on Monday morning, which allowed the EPS faction to hold the GC meet,
                            the supreme decision making body of the main opposition party in Tamil Nadu.</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>German luxury car maker Mercedes- Benz India registered strong double digit growth to post its
                    highest-ever second quarter sales in the country on back of new product launches and sustained
                    demand for existing vehicles.The record sales for Q2 were achieved despite significant headwinds
                    faced in form of continuing global supply side challenges leading to longer waiting periods and
                    continuous increase in operating costs.</p>
                <p>Martin Schwenk, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India commented, “Our highest ever Q2 is a
                    result of the positive customer sentiments, a young product portfolio across segments and successful
                    roll-out of Retail of the Future. This sales record becomes even more significant against the
                    backdrop of continued supply side challenges, triggered by global developments and also local market
                    challenges. It is highly satisfying to witness the unmatched aspiration and desire for a

                <p>Mercedes Benz said while it expects the semi-conductor shortage to continue in coming months, it will

                    period.

                    “We have a solid order bank of more than 6000+ cars which makes our market outlook very positive”,
                    informed Schwenk, adding, “Q3 will be highly exciting as we line-up some of the most anticipated

                <p>Lionsgate and Suretone Pictures will co-finance Suretone’s upcoming horror film ‘Creepers,’ based on
                    the novel by ‘Rambo’ creator David Morrell. Set to shoot this summer in Bulgaria, 'Creepers' follows
                    a group of young explorers who investigate an old abandoned hotel, only to encounter a strange
                    supernatural being and a competing group looking for a legendary hidden treasure.

                    The film is currently being cast by Mary Vernieu and Raylin Sabo and is set to begin production on
                    July 25, as per Variety.

                    It is directed by Marc Klasfeld, who is making his feature film debut. Klasfeld is best known for
                    his work directing music videos, including footage for Lady Gaga, Jay Z, Prince, Britney Spears,
                    Beyonce, Eminem, Katy Perry, Mariah Carey, Justin Timberlake, Shakira, Justin Bieber, Machine Gun
                    Kelly, Aerosmith, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
                    ‘Creepers’ is the latest collaboration between Suretone and Lionsgate. The two studios are also
                    currently developing the comedy ‘Revenge Wedding.’ Additionally, Suretone CEO and Chairman Jordan
                    Schur previously produced the 2019 film The Kid, distributed by Lionsgate and starring Ethan Hawke
                    and Dane DeHaan.

                    Schur was also a founding partner of Mimran Schur Pictures, which worked with Lionsgate on the films
                    ‘Warrior’ and ‘Rapturepalooza.’

                        transfer silence amid Chelsea links to man Utd icon</p>

                <hr style="border: 1px solid black;">
                <p>Thomas Tuchel has broken his silence on Cristiano Ronaldo's Chelsea transfer links.
                    Football.london understand that the Blues have sounded out a move for the striker, with Ronaldo keen
                    to ply his trade in the Champions League this season. According to ESPN, the Portugal international
                    is open to a move to Stamford Bridge, but Chelsea remain hesitant as to whether to escalate their
                    interest, with Tuchel believed to have been granted the final say.

                    The Portuguese star has not been included in Erik ten Hag's squad which has travelled to Thailand
                    for pre-season, with 'family reasons' cited as the reason for his absence. Ronaldo is yet to have
                    reported back for pre-season training, despite being expected to return last Monday.

                    Chelsea have travelled to the United States for pre-season. As seen on Twitter, after being greeted
                    by international fans, Tuchel was asked whether the club are going to sign Ronaldo. The German
                    replied by smiling and saying: "I will not tell you."
